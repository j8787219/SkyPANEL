2. **Maintenance Token**: Use a special token in the URL (`?maintenance_token=xxx`)
3. **Cookie-Based Bypass**: Browser cookie that persists across sessions
4. **Form Submission**: Enter token on maintenance page for temporary bypass

JavaScript resources like share-modal.js are properly loaded during maintenance mode to ensure the page functions correctly. The middleware checks for bypass conditions before blocking access to resources.

## üé® Brand Theming System

SkyVPS360 implements a comprehensive brand theming system that allows dynamic customization of the application's appearance through an advanced color management system.

### Color System Overview

The brand theming system uses three main colors:

- **Primary Color**: Used for primary buttons, navigation links, and important UI elements
- **Secondary Color**: Used for secondary actions, accents, and supporting elements
- **Accent Color**: Used for highlights, callouts, badges, and attention-grabbing elements

### Color Management Features

- **Interactive Color Pickers**: Visual color selection tools in admin settings
- **Hex Code Input**: Direct hex code entry for precise color control
- **Color Presets**: Quick-selection options for harmonious color combinations
- **Real-time Preview**: Live preview of color choices on UI components
- **Color Transformations**: Automatic generation of light/dark/opacity variations
- **Shadcn UI Integration**: Seamless integration with component library via CSS variables

### Implementation Details

- Colors are stored in the database as hex values (without # prefix)
- CSS variables are generated at runtime and applied to the document root
- Integration with Shadcn UI's theming system enables consistent styling
- Backward compatibility with legacy `companyColor` setting is maintained
- Comprehensive color variations (light, extraLight, dark, border, etc.) for each brand color

### Admin Configuration

To customize brand colors:

1. Navigate to **Admin ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí General**
2. In the **Brand Colors** section:
   - Use color pickers by clicking on color swatches
   - Enter hex codes directly in the input fields
   - Select from preset colors for quick styling
3. See real-time previews of how colors will appear in UI elements
4. Click **Save Changes** to apply the new color scheme globally

### Technical Implementation

The brand theming system is implemented in `client/src/lib/brand-theme.ts` with these key functions:

- `getBrandColors()`: Generates color variations for each brand color
- `hexToHSL()`: Converts hex colors to HSL format for Shadcn UI integration
- `applyBrandColorVars()`: Applies color variables to the document root
- `applyToShadcnTheme()`: Updates Shadcn UI theme variables

For more details on the technical implementation, see the [brand-theme.md](./brand-theme.md) documentation file.

## üîÑ VirtFusion Integration Guide

### Setting Up VirtFusion API Access

1. Obtain API credentials from your VirtFusion admin panel
2. Configure the `VIRTFUSION_API_URL` and `VIRTFUSION_API_KEY` environment variables
3. Test connectivity using the admin test endpoints

### User Integration

When integrating with VirtFusion, the application handles user mapping through:

1. **External Relation ID Mapping**: For API endpoints requiring `extRelationId`, we use the local `user.id` as the parameter, not `user.virtFusionId`
   - **IMPORTANT**: All VirtFusion API calls use our local user ID as the extRelationId parameter in URLs and requests
   - Example: `/users/{extRelationId}/byExtRelation/resetPassword` uses our local user.id value
2. **User Profile Sync**: When users update their profiles, we sync:
   - Username/name changes (VirtFusion API supports this)
   - Email changes (VirtFusion API supports this)
   - Password resets (Using VirtFusion's API-generated passwords)
   
### Password Integration with VirtFusion

The password reset process now fully integrates with VirtFusion:

1. Admin or user initiates a password reset
2. System makes a POST request to VirtFusion API: `/users/{extRelationId}/byExtRelation/resetPassword`
3. VirtFusion returns a secure temporary password in the response
4. System updates local database with the hashed VirtFusion-generated password
5. Both systems maintain password synchronization

```javascript
// Example of a VirtFusion password reset API call
const response = await virtFusionApi.resetUserPassword(user.id);
// Response format: {"data": {"email": "user@example.com", "password": "secureGeneratedPassword"}}
const temporaryPassword = response.data.password;
```

### Hourly Statistics Integration

For resource usage tracking:
```javascript
// Example: Fetching hourly statistics
const response = await axios.get(
  `${apiBaseUrl}/selfService/hourlyStats/byUserExtRelationId/${userId}`,
  { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${apiToken}` } }
);

// Parse the monthly total (handling both number and string formats)
const monthlyTotal = parseFloat(response.data.monthlyTotal.value);
```

- **Ticket Deleted**: When an admin deletes a ticket

#### Example Webhook Payload

```javascript
const payload = {
  content: roleId ? `<@&${roleId}>` : '',
  embeds: [{
    title: `New Support Ticket: ${ticket.subject}`,
    description: `A new support ticket has been created.`,
    color: 3447003, // Blue color
    fields: [
      { name: 'Ticket ID', value: `#${ticket.id}`, inline: true },
      { name: 'User', value: userName, inline: true },
      { name: 'Priority', value: ticket.priority || 'Medium', inline: true },
    ],
    footer: { text: `SkyVPS360 - ${companyName}` },
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()

const isAllowed = await this.isUserAllowed(interaction.user.id, member);

if (!isAllowed) {
  await interaction.reply({
    content: 'You do not have permission to use this command. Only authorized roles or users can manage tickets.',
    ephemeral: true
  });
  return;
}
```

## üë• User Management

### User Registration Flow

1. User submits registration form
2. Account is created with email verification required
3. Verification email is sent with unique code
4. User confirms email by entering verification code
5. Account is marked as verified and gains full access

### Password Reset Process

#### For Forgotten Passwords
1. User requests password reset via email
2. Secure reset token is generated and emailed
3. User verifies identity with token
4. New password is set and secured with bcrypt hashing
5. User is notified of successful password reset

#### Admin-Triggered Reset
1. Admin initiates password reset from user management page
2. System calls VirtFusion API to generate secure temporary password
3. Password is synchronized between dashboard and VirtFusion
4. Admin can view and copy the temporary password
5. User receives email notification with temporary password

#### User-Initiated Reset (Profile Page)
1. User enters current password on profile page
2. System calls VirtFusion API to generate secure temporary password
3. Password is synchronized between dashboard and VirtFusion

## üîç Troubleshooting

### API Architecture Issues

- **Circular Dependencies**: 
  - Check import statements in routes.ts and routes_new.ts to avoid circular references
  - Make sure VirtFusionApi, AuthService, and EmailService are imported from the same module in all files
  - If API endpoints return success but don't actually modify data, check for duplicate route definitions

- **API Route Conflicts**: 
  - Ensure that the same endpoint (e.g., `/api/admin/plan-features`) is not defined in multiple files
  - Check server/index.ts for proper route imports (should use routes_new.ts for all routes)
  - Look for inconsistent field names between frontend forms and backend validation (e.g., title vs name)

- **Form Validation Errors**:
  - Verify error messages match field names used in the frontend forms
  - Check console logs for validation errors that might be hidden in the UI
  - Ensure required fields are properly marked in both frontend and backend code

### VirtFusion API Issues

- **Connection Problems**: Verify API URL and key in environment variables
- **Synchronization Issues**: Ensure correct parameter mapping in API calls
- **User Updates Failing**: Confirm VirtFusion user exists and extRelationId is correct
- **Debugging API Calls**: Enable detailed logging by setting `DEBUG=api:*` environment variable

### Transaction & Invoice Issues

- **Missing Transactions**: Check database connectivity and record creation
- **PDF Generation Fails**: Ensure pdfkit library is properly installed
- **Transaction Export Errors**: Verify transaction data completeness
- **Invoice Numbering**: Check invoice number generation sequence

### Authentication Problems

- **Login Failures**: Verify credentials storage and hash comparison
- **Session Expiration**: Check session configuration and timeout settings
- **Password Reset Issues**: 
  - Confirm email delivery and token validation
  - Verify VirtFusion API connectivity for password resets
  - Check proper error handling for VirtFusion API failures
- **Account Verification**: Test email delivery and code validation
